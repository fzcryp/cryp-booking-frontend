        <h2>3. Our Business Model</h2>
        <p>Pbookings.com operates as a travel search, comparison, and facilitation platform. We connect users with
            third-party travel providers such as airlines, hotels, accommodation providers, car rental companies,
            package travel operators, and travel insurance providers (“Travel Partners”).</p>
        <p>When you make or request a booking, relevant personal data must be shared with the applicable Travel Partner
            so they can deliver the requested service. Travel Partners act as independent data controllers once they
            receive your data.</p>
